# CPNT-201-Assignment-4-Nuxt: Stephan Taylor

## Repo

https://github.com/Stayl045/cpnt-201-npm-project-nuxt

## Code Journal Plan

- This assignment seemed complex (which it was to me) but was very fun to learn the ins and outs of how to install nuxt and add modules to it.
  - I am excited to see where we can go with this as we start using these tools more.

### Note Worth Information

- I just want to let you know that I based this assignment as I was following you on Thursday. Therefore, I have a parent folder. I am not sure if this is necessary. I didn't want to delete it as I was worried I might break something. I hope this is okay.

- I also added extra commits as there are a couple that where accidents and had no relevant context (1, 9 of the list are those)

### Struggles

- I couldn't figure out how to resolve the vulnerabilities for fear of breaking something. So I left that point unavailable to me.

### NPM Package Links

- [LoDash](https://github.com/cipami/nuxt-lodash#readme)
  - I choose this package as it does seem relevant to what we do as coders adding quality of life changes to how I code.
- [StoryBlok](https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok-nuxt)
  - Because its part of the rubric.
- [GoogleFonts](https://github.com/nuxt-community/google-fonts-module)
  - Another quality of life module that should simplify adding new fonts rather then going to the website.
- [Image](https://image.nuxtjs.org/)
  - Because its part of the rubric
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/)
  - Part of the rubric.

### Attributions

- Maryam helped me in terms of letting me know where the modules go once we install them.
