### NPM Package Links

- [LoDash](https://github.com/cipami/nuxt-lodash#readme)
  - I choose this package as it does seem relevant to what we do as coders adding quality of life changes to how I code.
- [StoryBlok](https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok-nuxt)
  - Because its part of the rubric.
- [GoogleFonts](https://github.com/nuxt-community/google-fonts-module)
  - Another quality of life module that should simplify adding new fonts rather then going to the website.
- [Image](https://image.nuxtjs.org/)
  - Because its part of the rubric
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/)
  - Part of the rubric.

### Struggles
